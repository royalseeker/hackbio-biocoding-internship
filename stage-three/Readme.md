This file, "[plant_health_data.csv](https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/blob/main/Python/Dataset/plant_health_data.csv)", contains biosensor data related to plant health monitoring. It includes timestamped measurements of environmental and physiological parameters critical to assessing plant health, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, nutrient levels, and plant stress signals.
* Is there a time of the day when plants are mostly stressed?
* Do you have suggestions for reducing plant stress
* Build a classification algorithm for detecting stress in plants
