# Plant Health Monitoring Project

## 🏡 About The Project

The Plant Health Monitoring Project aims to develop an automated system for monitoring plant health using biosensor data. This project leverages various environmental and physiological parameters, such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, nutrient levels, and plant stress signals, to assess and improve plant health.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes biosensor data to gather critical information about plant health.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes stress signals to identify patterns and times of day when plants are most stressed.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements classification algorithms to detect plant stress based on environmental parameters.
- **Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations to better understand plant health trends.

## 📊 Project Details

The dataset used in this project includes timestamped measurements of various parameters critical to assessing plant health. Key components of the project include:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Normalizing and scaling data for improved model performance.
2. **Stress Analysis**:
   - Identifying times of day when plants are most stressed using time series analysis.
3. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Implementing machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees) for stress classification.
   - Evaluating model performance using various metrics.
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations to illustrate stress levels and environmental conditions.
